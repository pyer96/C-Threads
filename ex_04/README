	For testing purposes the file 'large_txt' is left 
	in the exercise folder just in order to test the program.
	Its size is 20MB, and has been generated with 
	a program wrote for dbg/mngmt in the second laboratory.
	
	One possible usage:
		>	<./solution04> test
		>	input large_txt as filename within the program 
		> 	stop executing the program with END
		> 	verify the correctness with: `cmp large_txt test`
