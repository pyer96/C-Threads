	A User Level Scheduler has the disadvantage of not being able to 
	communicate with the kernel level scheduler, with which (moreover) 
	it can conflict.
	At User Level, also, is not possible to implement a waiting queue since
	it is completely managed by the kernel level scheduler and also because
	such user level scheduler should be always in memory and aware of the
	devices waiting queues and handle their interrupts.
